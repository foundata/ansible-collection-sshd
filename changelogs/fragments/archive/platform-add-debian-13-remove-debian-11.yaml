    ``foundata.sshd.run``: Removed Debian 11 (Bullseye) from the list of supported
    platforms. The role will continue to work on Debian 11 but will display a warning.
    To avoid this, either remain on or pin the previous version of the collection. Bugs
    and issues related to Debian 11 will no longer be fixed.
