bugfixes:
  - run role - Fixed a bug where the regex for commenting out duplicate sshd_config options would re-match already-commented lines on every run, prepending additional ``#`` characters. This occurred on Fedora 43 where ``/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-redhat.conf`` contains a TAB-indented ``AcceptEnv`` line, causing an empty string to enter the options list. When joined with ``|``, patterns like ``Port||HostKey`` matched empty strings at any position, affecting all lines.
