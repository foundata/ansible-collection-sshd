  1.2.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - 'run role - Fixed a bug where the regex for commenting out duplicate sshd_config

          options would re-match already-commented lines on every run, prepending

          additional ``#`` characters. This occurred on Fedora 43 where

          ``/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-redhat.conf`` contains a TAB-indented

          ``AcceptEnv`` line, causing an empty string to enter the options list.

          When joined with ``|``, patterns like ``Port||HostKey`` matched empty

          strings at any position, affecting all lines.
